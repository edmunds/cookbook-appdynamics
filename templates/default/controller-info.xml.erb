    <!-- This is the http(s) port of the AppDynamics Controller , If 'controller-ssl-enabled' below is set to true, you must
    specify the HTTPS port of the Controller, otherwise specify the HTTP port. Controller gets installed at port 8090 by default.
    If you set 'controller-ssl-enabled' to true, the Controller installs at port 8443.

    to the same as ${server.tier} This can be overridden with the system property '-Dappdynamics.agent.tierName'

    then you may refer to the same as ${server.name}. The value for server.name will be used as appdynamics node name
